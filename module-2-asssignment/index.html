                    I love watching cinema and absolutely love to learn the craft involved in making the 
                    spectacular happen in the huge screen. I spend most of my free time in watching TV-Series,
                    Web-series and movies. Favourite TV-Series are Game Of Thrones, Stranger Things, Peaky Blinders.

                    This is the game which I enjoyed most from my childhood. I often dwell into the statistics/facts and read
                    blogs about the best knocks and the other interesting things about it. Sehwag used to be my favourite but
                    now I like Virat.

                    Maths always seem challenging to me and the hidden beauty of this has paved the path to code a solution to 
                    a problem. I like to code and integrate things to make stuff happen. I would also love to understand
                    any CS concept involved in understanding/crafting the solution.
