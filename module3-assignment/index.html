                        I love watching cinema and absolutely love to learn the craft involved in making the 
                        spectacular happen in the huge screen. I spend most of my free time in watching TV-Series,
                        Web-series and movies. Favourite TV-Series are Game Of Thrones, Stranger Things, Peaky Blinders.

                        This is the game which I enjoyed most from my childhood. I often dwell into the statistics/facts and read
                        blogs about the best knocks and the other interesting things about it. Sehwag used to be my favourite but
                        now I like Virat.

                        Maths always seem challenging to me and the hidden beauty of this has paved the path to code a solution to 
                        a problem. I like to code and integrate things to make stuff happen. I would also love to understand
                        any CS concept involved in understanding/crafting the solution.
